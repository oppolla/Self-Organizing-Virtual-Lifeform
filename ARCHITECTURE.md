# SOVL System Architecture Specification

## Overview

The Self-Organizing Virtual Lifeform (SOVL) is an advanced AI framework engineered to emulate biologically inspired learning and adaptation. It integrates multiple language models to deliver coherent, contextually accurate outputs while autonomously refining its knowledge through exploration and memory consolidation. SOVL’s core capabilities include curiosity-driven exploration, a dream-inspired memory consolidation process, and scaffold-guided generation, all orchestrated through a robust command-line interface (CLI) for precise system control.

This specification provides a technical overview of SOVL’s architecture, detailing its components, workflows, and configuration options. It is intended for developers, researchers, and system architects seeking a comprehensive understanding of SOVL’s design.
