This code needs to be modularized. Each module should have a single responsibility. Shared utilities (e.g., logging, configuration parsing) should be placed in distinct utility modules. Keep the SOVLSystem class in its own module as the central orchestrator and delegate specific tasks to appropriate modules. Ensure no circular dependencies among the modules. Maintain consistent naming conventions for clarity and organization. To improve maintainability and modularity, it is suggested the code should be broken into the following modules:

data_utils.py
Purpose: Handle data loading, validation, and preprocessing.
Functions to include:
load_jsonl
Any utility functions for handling datasets (e.g., splitting into training and validation sets).

config_utils.py
Purpose: Manage configuration loading and validation.
Functions to include:
get_config_value
_validate_config
Purpose: This module can also centralize default configuration values.

training.py
Purpose: Handle training logic, including batch processing and optimizer setup.
Functions/Classes to include:
setup_optimizer
train_step
run_training_cycle
validate_epoch

model_utils.py
Purpose: Manage model initialization, tokenization, and utilities for working with transformer models.
Functions/Classes to include:
Model initialization logic for base and scaffold models.
get_cross_attention_layers
SimpleCrossAttentionFuser
build_token_map

sovl_system.py
Purpose: Centralize the SOVL system's high-level logic and lifecycle management.
Functions/Classes to include:
SOVLSystem class and its methods.
Remove sub-functions that belong to other modules (e.g., data loading, training).
Retain system-specific operations, like wake_up, dream, and lifecycle management.

logging_utils.py
Purpose: Handle logging-related tasks for thread-safe logging.
Functions/Classes to include:
ThreadSafeLogger

curiosity.py
Purpose: Handle all aspects of the curiosity system.
Functions/Classes to include:
TrueCuriosity
CuriosityPressure
Related methods from SOVLSystem (e.g., generate_curiosity_question, tune_curiosity).

temperament.py
Purpose: Manage temperament scoring and updates.
Functions/Classes to include:
_update_temperament
Any temperament-related constants or logic.

dreaming.py
Purpose: Handle the "dreaming" functionality.
Functions/Classes to include:
_dream
_should_dream
Any related parameters or logic

constants.py
Purpose: Contain static constants and default values to avoid hardcoding them across modules.
Functions to include:
Default configuration values.
Thresholds or static parameters.

Maintain the logic flow by ensuring all interdependent methods and variables are properly referenced across modules.
Use dependency injection where necessary to avoid tight coupling between modules.
Write documentation for each module to describe its purpose and responsibilities.
Expected Output:

A set of clean, organized modules with no loss of functionality.
Minimal changes to the SOVLSystem class other than delegating tasks to the newly created modules.
Updated imports and initialization logic to reflect the new module structure.
