This code needs to be modularized. Each module should have a single responsibility. Shared utilities (e.g., logging, configuration parsing) should be placed in distinct utility modules. Keep the SOVLSystem class in its own module as the central orchestrator and delegate specific tasks to appropriate modules. Ensure no circular dependencies among the modules. Maintain consistent naming conventions for clarity and organization. To improve maintainability and modularity, it is suggested the code should be broken into the following modules:

1. Core System Modules:

system_config: Functions and constants for loading and managing configurations (get_config_value, _validate_config, configuration constants).

system_logging: Code handling the ThreadSafeLogger for logging interactions and errors.

2. Data Handling Modules:

data_loader: Functions for loading and validating data (load_jsonl).

data_processing: Helpers for tokenizing and mapping sequences (tokenize_and_map, map_sequence, _update_token_map_memory).

3. Model Management Modules:

model_loader: Functions for loading and configuring the base and scaffold models (SOVLSystem initialization logic).

quantization: Functions and logic for handling quantization modes (set_quantization_mode).

cross_attention: Functions for cross-attention injection (_insert_cross_attention, get_cross_attention_layers).

4. Training and Optimization Modules:

training: Functions for training the models (train_step, run_training_cycle, setup_optimizer).

validation: Functions for validation (validate_epoch).

gestation: Functions for gestation and sleep training (_gestate, _sleep_train, _should_gestate).

5. Dream and Memory Management Modules:
dream: Functions related to the dreaming mechanism (_dream, _should_dream, dream_memory handling).

memory_manager: Handling memory decay and pruning (token_map, dream_memory_decay, scaffold_memory).

6. Curiosity and Feedback Modules:

curiosity: Code related to the curiosity mechanism (TrueCuriosity, CuriosityPressure).

feedback: Functions for managing feedback and temperament (adjust_temperament, _update_temperament).

7. Error Handling Modules:

error_handling: Functions for managing errors (_handle_error_prompt, error-related logging).
Utilities

utils: Utility functions (calculate_confidence_score, get_life_curve_weight, etc.).

constants: Constants for default values (e.g., MAX_SEQ_LENGTH, BATCH_SIZE).

Main Application Module:

main: Entry point for running the SOVL system (__main__ block, user commands).

Each module can be organized into separate files, and shared functionality can be placed in common utility modules. This modularization should improve readability, maintainability, and testability.

Maintain the logic flow by ensuring all interdependent methods and variables are properly referenced across modules.
Use dependency injection where necessary to avoid tight coupling between modules.
Write documentation for each module to describe its purpose and responsibilities.
Expected Output:

A set of clean, organized modules with no loss of functionality.
Minimal changes to the SOVLSystem class other than delegating tasks to the newly created modules.
Updated imports and initialization logic to reflect the new module structure.
