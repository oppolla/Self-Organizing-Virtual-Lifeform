Refactor and modularize the codebase into distinct modules to improve readability, maintainability, and testability. Each module should have a **single responsibility**, and shared utilities (e.g., logging, configuration parsing) should be placed in common utility modules. Avoid circular dependencies by using dependency injection where necessary. Ensure minimal changes to the `SOVLSystem` class, delegating tasks to appropriate modules. To improve maintainability and modularity, it is suggested the code should be broken into the following modules:

1. Core System Modules:

- system_config: Functions and constants for loading and managing configurations (get_config_value, _validate_config, configuration constants).

- system_logging: Code handling the ThreadSafeLogger for logging interactions and errors.

2. Data Handling Modules:

- data_loader: Functions for loading and validating data (load_jsonl).

- data_processing: Helpers for tokenizing and mapping sequences (tokenize_and_map, map_sequence, _update_token_map_memory).

3. Model Management Modules:

- model_loader: Functions for loading and configuring the base and scaffold models (SOVLSystem initialization logic).

- quantization: Functions and logic for handling quantization modes (set_quantization_mode).

- cross_attention: Functions for cross-attention injection (_insert_cross_attention, get_cross_attention_layers).

4. Training and Optimization Modules:

- training: Functions for training the models (train_step, run_training_cycle, setup_optimizer).

- validation: Functions for validation (validate_epoch).

- gestation: Functions for gestation and sleep training (_gestate, _sleep_train, _should_gestate).

5. Dream and Memory Management Modules:
   
- dream: Functions related to the dreaming mechanism (_dream, _should_dream, dream_memory handling).

- memory_manager: Handling memory decay and pruning (token_map, dream_memory_decay, scaffold_memory).

6. Curiosity and Feedback Modules:

- curiosity: Code related to the curiosity mechanism (TrueCuriosity, CuriosityPressure).

- feedback: Functions for managing feedback and temperament (adjust_temperament, _update_temperament).

7. Error Handling Modules:

- error_handling: Functions for managing errors (_handle_error_prompt, error-related logging).

Guidelines:

1. Define Input and Output Expectations:
   - Clearly define the inputs, outputs, and side effects of each function and module.

2. Dependency Management:
   - Use dependency injection for shared resources (e.g., logger, configuration manager).

3. Documentation:
   - Add a module-level docstring describing the purpose and responsibilities.
   - Provide inline comments for complex logic.

4. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for each module. Mock dependencies during testing.

5. Code Style:
   - Use `snake_case` for file and function names.
   - Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.

6. Transition Process:
   - Start by moving utility functions (e.g., logging, configuration parsing) to separate modules.
   - Gradually refactor larger classes and functions into their respective modules.

7. Performance and Compatibility:
   - Ensure no significant performance overhead is introduced.
   - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.8+.

Example Refactoring:

Original Code:
```python
def load_jsonl(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return [json.loads(line) for line in file]
```

Refactored Code (`data_loader.py`):
```python
def load_jsonl(file_path: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Load data from a JSONL file."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return [json.loads(line) for line in file]
```
Each module can be organized into separate files, and shared functionality can be placed in common utility modules. This modularization should improve readability, maintainability, and testability.

Maintain the logic flow by ensuring all interdependent methods and variables are properly referenced across modules.
Use dependency injection where necessary to avoid tight coupling between modules.

Write documentation for each module to describe its purpose and responsibilities.
Expected Output:

A set of clean, organized modules with no loss of functionality.
Minimal changes to the SOVLSystem class other than delegating tasks to the newly created modules.
Updated imports and initialization logic to reflect the new module structure.

Quality Assurance Checklist:

- [ ] Each module has a single responsibility.
- [ ] Shared utilities are in utility modules.
- [ ] No circular dependencies exist.
