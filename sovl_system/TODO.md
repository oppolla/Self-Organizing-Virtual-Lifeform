## Key Feature - Lightweight Decision-Making Framework 
- Implement Lightweight Decision-Making Framework for Automomous Decision Making
   
Design and integrate a flexible decision-making mechanism into the SOVL System, enabling lightweight, adaptable reasoning for various system optimization tasks. The framework will initially focus on evaluating memory health metrics and making adjustments for stability using LLM-based reasoning, with the potential to expand to other domains in the future like the ability to control it's own parametrs. 

**Define Input Metrics**:
Identify key metrics relevant to specific optimization tasks (e.g., Memory Usage, Error Rate, Stability Score for memory health).
Ensure metrics are well-defined, measurable, and consistently available in the system.

**Design Prompt Structure**:
Create clear, adaptable prompts to feed metrics into the LLM for decision-making.

Example Prompt:
```
Given the following [task-specific] metrics:  
Metric 1: [value]  
Metric 2: [value]  
Metric 3: [value]  
Decide if adjustments are needed. Respond only with true or false.  
```
**Implement Integration**:
Build a mechanism to feed relevant metrics into the LLM as input for decision-making.
Ensure outputs are captured and processed appropriately to drive system actions.
Develop Validation and Safety Checks:

Validate input metrics to ensure they are within acceptable ranges before passing them to the LLM.
Implement safeguards to handle invalid, unclear, or ambiguous LLM outputs.

**Build a Feedback Loop**:
Use the LLM's decisions (e.g., true/false or recommendations) to trigger appropriate actions within the system.
Define reversible or fail-safe actions for unstable states and ensure they are task-agnostic.

**Testing and Evaluation**:
Simulate various scenarios to test the accuracy and reliability of the decision-making framework.
Validate the system's performance and stability under different decision outputs.
Optional Enhancements:

Allow for more nuanced LLM responses, such as adjustment recommendations or confidence scores, for future tasks.
Introduce monitoring to log decisions and track performance for continuous improvement.
Documentation:

Document the framework, including prompt structures, input metrics, and integration guidelines.
Provide examples of initial use cases (e.g., memory health system) and potential future applications.
By implementing this broader framework, the SOVL System can leverage LLM-based reasoning to address diverse optimization scenarios beyond memory health, fostering a lightweight and extensible decision-making architecture.

**Possible Enhancement**: 
In addition to its memory health evaluation, the Lightweight Decision-Making Framework can be expanded to dynamically adjust system parameters such as computation priority, model quantization modes (e.g., FP16, INT8), and task scheduling thresholds based on real-time resource usage metrics. For instance, the system could monitor GPU utilization, optimize batch sizes during training, or switch to lower precision modes to mitigate memory bottlenecks. This enhancement would foster a more adaptive, resource-aware architecture, allowing the SOVL System to maintain performance stability under varying workloads while minimizing manual intervention.

**Positive Implications**:
Autonomous Optimization: The system can adapt dynamically to real-time conditions, such as adjusting memory usage, task prioritization, or model parameters without external intervention.
Early Problem Detection: By continuously monitoring resource usage, error rates, and performance metrics, it can identify potential issues (e.g., memory saturation or GPU overload) before they cause critical failures.

**Improved Stability**: Proactive adjustments based on health metrics can prevent instability, reducing the chances of unexpected crashes.

**Risks and Mitigations**:
Decision Feedback Loops: If the decision-making process itself consumes significant resources or introduces unnecessary adjustments, it could amplify resource usage and push the system to failure.

**Mitigation**: Implement lightweight monitoring and ensure that self-assessments are low-cost in terms of memory and computation.
Overreaction to Metrics: If thresholds are too sensitive or improperly defined, the system may overcorrect, leading to instability or degraded performance (e.g., reducing batch sizes unnecessarily or switching to inefficient modes).

**Mitigation**: Use hysteresis (e.g., only act if metrics exceed thresholds consistently) and validate decisions in test environments.
Resource Starvation: Monitoring and decision-making consume resources themselves. If the system is under heavy load, these processes could exacerbate the problem and potentially cause a crash.

**Mitigation**: Reserve a small percentage of resources exclusively for monitoring and decision-making tasks to prevent starvation.
Faulty Decision Logic: If the logic guiding adjustments is flawed or incomplete, the decisions could worsen the situation (e.g., reducing performance-critical parameters unnecessarily).

**Mitigation**: Include robust validation, safety checks, and fallback mechanisms to prevent invalid or harmful actions.
Lack of Reversibility: Some decisions might not be easily reversible, such as offloading critical data or switching to a degraded operational mode.

**Mitigation**: Design reversible and fail-safe actions to ensure the system can recover from unintended consequences.

### Expanded Features:

**Self-Diagnostic Checks**:
To ensure continuous operational health, the SOVL System will integrate periodic self-diagnostic checks. These checks will monitor key metrics such as memory usage, token consumption, and response latency to detect early signs of inefficiency or instability. Lightweight self-assessment routines will validate whether the system's internal state meets predefined health thresholds before proceeding with any computationally intensive tasks. If anomalies are detected, the system will flag them for further analysis or initiate fail-safe mechanisms to prevent cascading failures. Additionally, diagnostic logs will be maintained for debugging and performance optimization purposes, fostering a robust and resilient architecture.

**Contextual Focus**:
To enhance relevance and efficiency, the SOVL System will implement a dynamic contextual focus mechanism. This feature will prioritize recent and task-specific context over older or less relevant information when processing inputs. By allocating attention weights dynamically, the system can maintain optimal performance during lengthy sessions or multitasking scenarios. The mechanism will also include safeguards to prevent context dilution, ensuring critical information remains accessible while irrelevant data is deprioritized. This adaptive approach will enable the system to respond accurately and efficiently to user queries, even in resource-constrained environments.



# Modularization Tasts
- Logger logic needs to be cleaned up and refined between modules
- Curiousity logic needs to be made into it's own module from its current disparate locations like trainer and state modules
