# TODO:
1. Implement Lightweight Decision-Making for Memory Health Stability via LLM Prompts
Description:
Design and integrate a lightweight decision-making mechanism into the SOVL System. The system will evaluate memory health metrics and decide if adjustments are needed for stability using LLM-based reasoning. This feature will leverage the LLM's capabilities to provide a simple and adaptable solution without introducing additional components.

Steps to Implement:
Define Input Metrics:

Identify the key memory health metrics that will be used for decision-making (e.g., Memory Usage, Error Rate, Stability Score, etc.).
Ensure metrics are well-defined, measurable, and consistently available in the system.
Design Prompt Structure:

Create a clear, concise prompt to feed the memory health metrics to the LLM.
Example Prompt:
Code
Given the following memory health metrics:
- Memory Usage: [value]%
- Error Rate: [value]%
- Stability Score: [value]/100

Decide if adjustments are needed for stability. Respond only with `true` or `false`.
Implement Integration:

Add a mechanism to feed the memory health metrics into the LLM as input.
Ensure the outputs (true or false) are captured and processed appropriately.
Develop Validation and Safety Checks:

Validate metrics before passing them to the LLM to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
Implement safeguards to handle LLM outputs that are invalid, unclear, or ambiguous.
Build a Feedback Loop:

Use the LLM's decision (true or false) to trigger appropriate actions within the system.
Define adjustment actions for unstable memory states and ensure these actions are reversible or fail-safe.
Testing and Evaluation:

Simulate various memory health scenarios to test the LLM's decision-making accuracy.
Validate the system's overall performance and stability under different decision outputs.
Optional Enhancements:

Allow for more nuanced responses from the LLM, such as adjustment recommendations or confidence scores.
Introduce monitoring to log LLM decisions for further analysis and improvement.
Documentation:

Document the prompt structure, input metrics, and integration steps.
Include examples of decision scenarios and how they are handled in the system.
