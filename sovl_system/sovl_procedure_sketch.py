"""
Module: sovl_procedure_sketch.py

This sketch outlines the system for detecting, defining, storing,
and logging new procedures within the SOVL architecture.

Core Idea:
1. DialogueContextManager (DCM) in sovl_recaller.py is central. It processes
   incoming messages and uses ProcedureDetector logic to identify potential procedures.
2. If a procedure is detected, parsed, and confirmed, DCM *immediately* stores
   it in its internal, persistent procedural memory.
3. After internal storage, DCM calls the Scriber to log a "procedure_defined"
   (or similar) event. This event, enriched by MetadataProcessor, enters the
   main scribe journal for auditing and potential LoRA learning about the *event*
   of skill acquisition.
4. The procedure definition itself is *not* "trained" via sovl_trainer.py's
   gestation cycle. It's made available operationally by DCM.

Key Modules Involved:
 - sovl_recaller.py (DialogueContextManager): Owns procedure detection,
   internal storage, and initiates scribing.
 - sovl_scribe.py (Scriber): Receives the "procedure_defined" event,
   enriches it via MetadataProcessor, and logs it to the scribe journal.
 - sovl_processor.py (MetadataProcessor): Enriches metadata for the
   "procedure_defined" event. Also (ScribeIngestionProcessor) defines
   how this event is templated for LoRA if it's part of training data.
