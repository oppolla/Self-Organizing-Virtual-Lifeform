Step-by-Step Guide to Loading a Local Model and Running SOVL

Prerequisites

Python Environment: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Dependencies: Install the required packages:
Apply to sovl_main.py
Run
bitsandbytes
Local Model: Have a Hugging Face model (e.g., Llama-2-7b) downloaded locally.

Step 1: Prepare the Configuration File
Create a sovl_config.json file in your workspace with the following structure:
Apply to sovl_main.py
}
Replace /path/to/your/local/model with the actual path to your model.

Step 2: Initialize the System
Create a Python script (e.g., run_sovl.py) with the following code:
Apply to sovl_main.py
)

Step 3: Run the Script
Execute the script:
Apply to sovl_main.py
Run
py

Step 4: Verify the System
Check Logs: The system will log events to the console and/or a log file (if configured).
Monitor Metrics: Use the SystemMonitor (from sovl_monitor.py) to track memory, training progress, and curiosity scores.
CLI Interaction: If you've integrated the CLI (sovl_cli.py), you can interact with the system using commands like:
train: Start training.
monitor start: Begin monitoring system metrics.
status: Check system status.
Troubleshooting
Model Loading Errors:
Ensure the model path in sovl_config.json is correct.
Verify the model is compatible with transformers (e.g., it should have a config.json file).
CUDA Errors:
Ensure you have a compatible GPU and CUDA installed.
Fall back to CPU by setting device="cpu" in SystemContext.
Configuration Issues:
Validate sovl_config.json using the ConfigHandler in sovl_main.py.
