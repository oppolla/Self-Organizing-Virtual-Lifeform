"""
This test file is designed to validate the core functionalities of the SOVL System (Self-Organizing Virtual Lifeform),
an AI system with autonomous learning and decision-making capabilities. The tests are written using the pytest framework
and focus on three critical aspects of the system: decision-making, adaptability, and adherence to ethical guidelines.

Key Components:
1. SOVLSystem Class:
   - This class represents the system under test (SUT). It includes methods for decision-making, environmental adaptation,
     and ethical response generation.
   - The methods are mocked to simulate realistic AI behavior, including logging for traceability.

2. Test Cases:
   - Each test case is designed to simulate specific scenarios and validate the behavior of the SOVLSystem against expected outcomes.

Test Details:
1. Autonomous Decision-Making (test_autonomous_decision_making):
   - Validates the `make_decision` method.
   - Scenario 1: Tests the system's ability to process structured inputs with priorities and return a sorted list based on criticality.
   - Scenario 2: Handles ambiguous, unstructured input and ensures the system can process it gracefully.

2. Adaptability (test_adaptability):
   - Validates the `adapt_to_environment` method.
   - Scenario 1: Verifies that the system can incorporate new data into its knowledge base and adapt accordingly.
   - Scenario 2: Ensures that the system dynamically integrates new rules or environmental changes while executing tasks.

3. Ethical Guidelines (test_ethical_guidelines):
   - Validates the `respond_ethically` method.
   - Scenario 1: Tests the system's response to inputs with bias, ensuring a neutral response is generated.
   - Scenario 2: Verifies the system respects privacy and avoids sensitive information when handling specific inputs.
   - Scenario 3: Ensures the system provides constructive and ethical responses to general ethical dilemmas.

Execution:
- The tests are executed using pytest. To run the tests, execute the script as a standalone Python file or run `pytest` directly.
- Logging is configured to provide detailed information during test execution, aiding in debugging and traceability.

Overall, this test suite ensures the SOVL System behaves as expected in critical areas, supporting its autonomous learning and ethical capabilities.
