"""
This script performs a set of stress tests on the SOVLSystem to evaluate its performance, stability, and error handling.
The tests include:

1. Cold Start Test:
   - Verifies the system's ability to generate output immediately after initialization.
   - Checks for any issues during the initial setup phase.

2. Training Stress Test:
   - Runs a short training cycle using predefined training and validation data.
   - Tests the system's ability to handle training processes without failures.

3. Memory Test:
   - Stresses the memory by repeatedly generating output with large input and large token limits.
   - Evaluates the system's capability to manage memory-intensive tasks.

4. Error Recovery Test:
   - Intentionally provides extreme inputs (e.g., empty input or large token generation requests).
   - Observes the system's ability to handle errors gracefully and recover.

These tests aim to ensure the robustness and reliability of the SOVLSystem under various conditions.
