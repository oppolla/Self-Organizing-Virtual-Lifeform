Abstract

YAML™ (rhymes with “camel”) is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data serialization language designed around the common native data types of dynamic programming languages. It is broadly useful for programming needs ranging from configuration files to internet messaging to object persistence to data auditing and visualization. Together with the Unicode standard for characters4, this specification provides all the information necessary to understand YAML version 1.2 and to create programs that process YAML information.
